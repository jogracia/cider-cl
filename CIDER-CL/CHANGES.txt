CIDER-CL 1.2 (Sep 15, 2013)
------------------------
* IMPROVED: added documentation, logs, and examples


CIDER-CL 1.1 (Sep 09, 2013)
------------------------
Version submitted to OAEI'13 campaign for evaluation

* FIXED: compatibility issues with Seals platform fixed

* TRAINING SET: 
Monolingual alignments: Benchmark track OAEI'11 but excluding cases 202 and 248-266 (which present a total absence
or randomization of labels and comments).
Cross-lingual alignments: Multifarm track OAEI'13; languages: en, es, nl, de; ontologies: cmt, conference, confOf, sigkdd (all comparisons among them but excluding comparisons between the same ontologies)


CIDER-CL 1.0 (Aug 26, 2013)
------------------------
INITIAL VERSION. This is a complete reimplementation of CIDER that adds cross-lingual capabilities. 
This is based on the SoftTFIDF measure to compute monolingual similarities and Explicit Semantic Analysis to compute crosslingual similarities. 
Similarities are computed at different levels of the ontologial context (labels, super/subterms, etc.) and combined using artificial neural networks.
